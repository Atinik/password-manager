# password-manager
The local password manager is a secure solution for managing and storing passwords locally on your system. It allows users to securely store website login credentials (username and hashed password) and retrieve them when needed

1. Overview:
The local password manager is a secure solution for managing and storing passwords locally on your system. It allows users to securely store website login credentials (username and hashed password) and retrieve them when needed.

2. Components:

Docker: Docker is used as the hosting platform to containerize and manage the application's components. It helps ensure consistency across different environments.

PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system. It's used to store and manage the encrypted password data.

Python Flask: Python Flask is a micro web framework used to build the backend of the application. It exposes API endpoints for adding and retrieving passwords.

SHA-256 Hashing: The SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used to securely hash and store passwords. Hashing ensures that passwords are not stored in plaintext, enhancing security.

3. Features:

Add Password: Users can add website login credentials (website, username, and password) to the password manager.

Retrieve Password: Users can retrieve stored passwords by providing the website name.

4. Workflow:

The user interacts with the Flask-based API by sending HTTP requests to add or retrieve passwords.

When adding a password, the application hashes the password using SHA-256 before storing it in the PostgreSQL database.

When retrieving a password, the user provides the website name. The application retrieves the stored hashed password from the database and compares it with the hash of the entered password to verify its correctness.

Docker containers ensure that the application components (Python Flask app and PostgreSQL database) are isolated and easily deployable.

5. Benefits:

Security: Passwords are securely hashed before storage, minimizing the risk of data breaches. Storing data locally reduces exposure to online threats.

Isolation: Docker containers provide isolation between components, reducing potential conflicts and compatibility issues.

Control: Users have full control over their password data, which is stored locally on their systems.

6. Considerations:

Security: Ensure that passwords are hashed and stored securely. Implement additional security measures as needed.

Backup: Users are responsible for backing up their password data to prevent data loss.

User Interface: The project as described focuses on the backend. A graphical user interface (GUI) could be added for better user interaction.

Note: While this project provides a basic foundation for a local password manager, real-world password management applications require additional features, such as encryption, secure authentication, and master passwords, to ensure strong security. It's important to thoroughly test and secure the application before use.
